== about assembly sign of Azuki.dll ==
This package contains Azuki.dll which are digitally signed.
The reason why it is signed is,
they can be referenced by other signed assembly if it is signed.
Ensuring that the assemblies are not altered is NOT the reason.
If you will be needed to prove that
the Azuki.dll you are using is not altered,
you SHOULD build another Azuki.dll from source code package
with your own key file.
