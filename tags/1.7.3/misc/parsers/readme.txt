To generate parsers,
just double click (or kick in command prompt)
"MakeAllParsers.bat" in this directory.
Then parsers are generated and copied to path next:

    {src_root}/Azuki/Highlight/Coco

Note that generating parser needs the executable of Coco/R for C#.
If you don't have it, get it and place the Coco.exe in this directory
or in any directory specified in PATH environment variable.
